This repository contains a reproducible Python implementation accompanying the paper:

“Operator Learning for Prescribed-Time Stabilization of Reaction-Diffusion Systems.”

The code implements the neural-operator-based framework proposed in the paper for approximating time-varying backstepping kernels arising in prescribed-time stabilization of reaction–diffusion PDE systems.
